3. Living-Off-the-Land (LotL) Deployment

Living-off-the-land techniques involve using legitimate tools and processes already present in the target environment to deploy and execute malware.

Key Trends:

Trusted Tools Exploitation: Attackers will increasingly use legitimate tools like PowerShell, WMI, and bash scripts to deploy malware.

Memory-Only Deployment: Malware will avoid writing to disk, instead operating directly from memory to evade detection.

Supply Chain Infiltration: LotL techniques will be used to compromise software updates and development pipelines for deployment.


Potential Impact:
By blending in with legitimate operations, LotL malware will bypass traditional detection systems, necessitating a focus on behavioral analysis and anomaly detection.
