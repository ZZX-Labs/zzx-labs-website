  "description": "GP is a framework for composing Personal Digital Assistants from large language and multi-modal models. It includes a skill system (web fetch, code exec, RAG, calendar/mail hooks), prompt routing, policy modules (with separate SFW/NSFW profiles), and optional on-device inference. Operators can run GP offline, in hybrid mode, or fully managed. Audit logs, safety filters, and consent gates are built-in.",
