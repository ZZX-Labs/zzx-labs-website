  "description": "URLScraper is a lightweight Firefox WebExtension that harvests links from the current tab (anchors, media sources, iframe src, background-image URLs, and selectable text). It normalizes and de-duplicates the results, lets you apply include/exclude patterns or same-host rules, and exports to clipboard, CSV, NDJSON, or plaintext. All processing is local by default; optional host permissions enable per-site rules.",
