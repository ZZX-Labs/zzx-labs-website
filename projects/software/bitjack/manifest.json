  "description": "BitJack is a Bitcoin-first Blackjack engine featuring verifiable randomness (commitâ€“reveal or VRF), Lightning micro-bets and payouts, and replayable round transcripts for audits. The shuffle, dealing order, and dealer actions derive from public seeds, making each round independently checkable by players. Operators can run single or multi-table lobbies with configurable min/max stakes, house edge, and dispute logs. Optional BitRNG beacon integration, PSBT settlement, and watch-only accounting included.",
