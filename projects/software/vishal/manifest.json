  "description": "Vishal is a visual shell that gives operators situational awareness across batch pipelines. It consumes compact JSON/NDJSON event streams from runners like Vikram (and custom adapters) to render queue depth, worker health, job lifecycle, retries, latency distributions, and artifact timelines. It ships with a terminal UI for low-friction server sessions and an optional web UI for wallboards.",
