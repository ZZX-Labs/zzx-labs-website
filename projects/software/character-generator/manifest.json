  "description": "A local-first toolkit for structured character creation. Define archetype schemas, roll/curate traits with weighted randomness and deterministic seeds, generate biographies and dialogue samples, and export clean JSON/Markdown sheets. Optional model hooks for portrait concept art and voice samples. Guardrails enforce lore/rating constraints; signed template packs ensure continuity across projects or campaigns.",
