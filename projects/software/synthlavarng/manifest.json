  "description": "SynthLavaRNG is a digital reimagining of SGI’s Lavarand and LavaRnd. It renders animated, parameterized visual systems (lava blobs, fireflies, kaleidoscopes, ripples, swarms, fractals, etc.) and ingests each frame into a rolling SHA3-256 pool. An HMAC-DRBG (SHA3-256) is reseeded on a schedule or on-demand. Optional external entropy can be mixed in from BitRNG (Bitcoin-derived chain/mempool data). Designed for offline, local-first use with a PyQt5 GUI, it targets seeding workflows, cryptographic testing, and research.",
