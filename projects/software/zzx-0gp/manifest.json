  "description": "ZZX-0GP wraps GnuPG workflows with a simple interface. Generate and manage keys (ed25519/cv25519 or RSA), encrypt/decrypt files and text, create attached or detached signatures, verify authenticity, publish to keyservers, and export SSH-compatible keys. The page produces copy-pasteable gpg commands and can optionally call a local server endpoint to execute them. Use strong passphrases, keep secret keys offline when possible, and verify fingerprints out-of-band.",
