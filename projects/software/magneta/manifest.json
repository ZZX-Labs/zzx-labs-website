  "description": "Magneta is a cross-platform, open-source data sanitization toolkit that securely and verifiably erases storage media (HDD, SSD, NVMe, SD/microSD, USB). It blends firmware-level secure erase (ATA/NVMe) with cryptographic overwrites and multi-pass randomization, generating JSON/HTML audit reports with SHA3-256 verification. Operates fully offline with both CLI and PyQt5 GUI, and ships with policy templates aligned to NIST 800-88 and DoD 5220.22-M.",
