  "description": "BitRNG exposes beacon and commitâ€“reveal primitives backed by Bitcoin. Entropy is derived from block headers, aggregated commitments, and SPV proofs to resist manipulation. Workflows cover one-off draws, rolling beacons, and multi-party commitments with time-locked slashing. Each draw emits a public transcript: inputs, derivation algorithm, block references, transcript hash, and verifier steps, enabling independent recomputation by anyone.",
