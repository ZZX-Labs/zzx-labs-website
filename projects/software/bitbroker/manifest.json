  "description": "BitBroker provides a venue-agnostic execution layer and microstructure lab for BTC spot markets. It unifies orderbooks (REST/WebSocket), normalizes trades/quotes, and lets you design and simulate routing policies â€” TWAP/VWAP/POV, impact-aware slicing, spread-sniping, and fallback rules. Includes adapters for common exchanges (extendable), per-fill slippage accounting, simulated fee models, and export to Parquet/CSV for offline study.",
