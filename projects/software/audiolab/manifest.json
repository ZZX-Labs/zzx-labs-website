  "description": "AudioLab is a modular digital-audio workbench written in Python. It unifies live sampling/looping, tone and noise generators, MIDI I/O, quantized sequencers, FX chains, spectrum/oscilloscope views, glitch synthesis, and TTS. Run it headless from the CLI or in a PyQt5 GUI for performance and lab workflows. Designed for reproducible sound experiments, live sets, and fast prototyping of DSP ideas.",
