  "description": "ZZX-MSP centralizes operations for multiple client tenants. It brings observability (metrics/logs/traces), alert routing and on-call schedules, scheduled backups with integrity verification and restore drills, safe patch windows, zero-trust access with short-lived credentials, approval gates for production, and policy-as-code with full audit trails. Runbooks compose Ansible, Terraform, and CLI tasks with dry-run/change-set workflows. Ticketing/billing integrations complete the loop.",
