Create markets from oracle announcements, accept orders via parimutuel pools or limit books, and settle outcomes with Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) over Lightning or on-chain. Features multi-oracle quorums, fee & edge accounting, dispute windows, watchtowers, and exportable receipts. Goal: minimize custody/oracle risk while keeping UX snappy.",
