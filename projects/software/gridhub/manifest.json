  "description": "GridHub composes multiple web pages into a single, flexible grid. Choose preset layouts (1×2, 2×2, 1×3, 2×3, 3×3) or define custom panes, reorder by drag, and save/load JSON layouts. Share a single link that encodes the full state in the URL hash. Sandboxed iframes are used when possible to improve safety, with opt-in relaxations for trusted hosts.",
