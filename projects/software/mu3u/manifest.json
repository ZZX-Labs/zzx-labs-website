Paste or import an existing playlist, tidy it up with de-duplication and sorting, validate entries, preview streams inline, and export clean lists — all locally in your browser with no server dependency. Ideal for radio/IPTV lists, podcast mirrors, long-form music sets, and personal streaming libraries.",
