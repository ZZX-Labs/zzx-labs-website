  "description": "bit-monitor gathers live telemetry from one or more Bitcoin Core nodes and optional public relays to surface actionable health signals: mempool pressure, feerate distributions, orphan/stale rates, peer churn, bandwidth, IBD/IBS status, policy/standardness edges, and potential reorg hints. It supports rule-based alerts via webhook/email, emits JSON/CLI for CI/CD and on-call workflows, and provides simple dashboards suitable for NOC screens.",
