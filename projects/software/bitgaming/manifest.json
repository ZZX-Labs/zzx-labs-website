  "description": "BitGaming is a modular stack for Bitcoin-native games. It supports Lightning for instant microstakes, on-chain settlement paths, and verifiable randomness via commitâ€“reveal, VRF, or BitRNG beacons. Each round exposes seeds, hashes, payouts, and house-edge math so players can reproduce outcomes. Operators get standardized modules for lobbies, tables, jackpots, and dispute logs, plus APIs for KYC-less wallets and watch-only accounting.",
