  "description": "audiosieve ingests large audio folders/archives and runs deterministic quality gates: silence %, clipping %, hum/buzz bands, DC offset, noise floor, sample rate/bit depth compliance, duration bands, and container/codec checks. Optional plugins provide language/profanity hints and VAD segmentation for ASR pre-clean. Outputs compact JSON/NDJSON with accept/reject + reasons and suggested remediations.",
