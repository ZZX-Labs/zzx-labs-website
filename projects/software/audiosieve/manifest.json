  "description": "AudioSieve ingests local audio folders, computes content hashes, and probes containers with ffprobe to build a SQLite catalog keyed by hash (path is mutable). Using Mutagen, it reads/writes tags across MP3/FLAC/OGG/OPUS/M4A/WAV/AIFF, normalizes artwork via Pillow, and organizes files into a canonical library with deterministic templates and collision policies. The PyQt5 GUI provides library browsing, tag editing, import & sort workflows, playlist creation (m3u/m3u8), and VLC-backed playback with seek, device selection, and basic visualization stubs. DSP modules expose parameter models for channel strip, EQ, and filters (offline render hooks now; live chain later). A lightweight Flask server offers local status and transport control, with optional LAN streaming planned. Defaults are privacy-preserving and non-destructive; configuration is externalized; logs and operations are deterministic and auditable.",
