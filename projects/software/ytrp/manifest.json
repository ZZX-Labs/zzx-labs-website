  "description": "YTRP/YTRPV is a small interface around yt-dlp. YTRP focuses on clean audio rips (m4a/mp3/opus/flac) with embedded metadata and cover art; YTRPV focuses on video rips with muxed best-video+audio, embedded/sidecar subtitles, and chapters. Build a command to paste into your terminal or point this page at a local API wrapper for one-click runs. Use responsibly and comply with source-site terms.",
