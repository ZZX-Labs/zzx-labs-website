Create watchlists for addresses, descriptors, and txids; annotate with labels and notes including provenance; subscribe to rule-based alerts (webhook/email); and export signed, timestamped evidence bundles for reports. Uses your own full node and optional public mempool relays. Supports PSBT/descriptor parsing, Tor, and air-gapped exports.",
