  "description": "archive-tagger crawls directories and packaged archives (zip/tar), computes strong checksums (e.g., BLAKE3/SHA-256), extracts technical and descriptive metadata (EXIF, media streams, dimensions, codecs), and writes stable sidecar tags (JSON/NDJSON) for long-term preservation. It emphasizes reproducibility, low overhead, and audit-friendly outputs.",
