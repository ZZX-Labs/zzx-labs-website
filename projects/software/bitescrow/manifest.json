  "description": "BitEscrow provides a reproducible, non-custodial escrow flow for Bitcoin. Parties co-sign PSBTs across a 2-of-3 multisig (buyer, seller, arbiter), with optional DLC-based outcome resolution when objective events are involved. Policies are human-readable and version-controlled; transactions are simulated before broadcast; and artifacts are exportable for independent verification. Focus areas: dispute minimization, UX for signatures, and clear on-chain evidence.",
