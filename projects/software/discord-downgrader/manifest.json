  "description": "discord-downgrader makes audio uploads painless for Discord’s size cap. Drop in a file and get an output that reliably falls under a safe threshold (e.g., 9.5 MB). It prioritizes Opus for quality-per-byte with MP3/M4A fallbacks, uses VBR size targeting, optional mono downmix, auto resampling, loudness normalization, and quick tails with micro-fades. Batch-friendly and offline-first.",
