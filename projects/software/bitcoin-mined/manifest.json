It parses coinbase transactions, subsidy and fee components, pool tags, and unusual fee outliers, then correlates them with your worker-level payouts. Features: CSV/JSON exports, per-epoch summaries, fee heatmaps, alerts for anomalous variance, and optional watch-only addresses for validating pool payments.",
