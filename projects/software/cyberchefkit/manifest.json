  "blurb": "Run GCHQ’s CyberChef unmodified — fully offline or served locally — plus language-mirror helpers (C/C++/Python/Go/R/Perl) for containerized recipe pipelines.",
  "description": "CyberChefKit is a localized online/offline container program that executes the upstream CyberChef build without modification. Use it as a portable desktop app, an air-gapped utility, or as a local/online server for teams. Around CyberChef, companion subprograms (CyberChefC, CyberChefCpp, CyberChefPy, CyberChefGo, CyberChefR, CyberChefPerl, etc.) mirror containerized workflow semantics across languages so you can integrate reproducible ‘recipe+IO’ pipelines directly in your native stack — while keeping CyberChef itself pristine.",
