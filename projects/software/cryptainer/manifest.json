  "description": "Cryptainer is a toolkit for producing verifiable, encrypted containers for private material and datasets. Features include layered encryption (passphrase, keyfiles, HSM hooks), manifest-driven policies, integrity hashes (SHA-256 / Blake2b), optional timelock release mechanisms, and exportable signed bundles for audit and storage. Use cases: wallet backups, seedphrase vaults, sealed dataset distribution, and reproducible sealed compute inputs.",
