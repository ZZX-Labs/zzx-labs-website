  "description": "Vishnu is a DAG-oriented orchestrator for coordinated media/data workflows. Define pipelines declaratively, attach resource policies and SLAs, and dispatch to runners (e.g., Vikram) or HTTP/Container tasks. Vishnu handles retries with jitter, backpressure, idempotency, and emits NDJSON events for live dashboards in Vishal. Audit-friendly with signed manifests and change history.",
