  "blurb": "End-to-end hashing for disks, arrays, and file trees with a tamper-evident catalog and fast lookups.",
  "description": "Hasher computes multi-algorithm digests across block devices, RAID/NAS arrays, and file trees. It supports fixed/adaptive chunk sizes, builds Merkle trees, resumes partial scans, and writes an append-only, signed manifest to SQLite or Postgres. The catalog enables rapid lookups (by path/inode/size/mtime/hash), dedup analysis, and export to JSONL/CSV/Parquet. CLI and service modes are available.",
