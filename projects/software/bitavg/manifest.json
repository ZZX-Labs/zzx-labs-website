  "description": "bitavg computes a globally weighted Bitcoin fair value using volume-adjusted averages across top exchanges and markets. It consolidates fiat pairs (USD, EUR, INR, JPY, GBP, etc.) and precious metals (XAU, XAG) into a unified index refreshing multiple times per second. Designed as a Python backend and lightweight API for dashboards, research, and sovereign systems, bitavg prioritizes transparency, reproducibility, and cryptographic integrity in all data pipelines. It integrates seamlessly with nginx, Flask, and Gunicorn for full-stack deployments, and supports modular integration into ZZX-Labs’ analytics architecture.",
