Users provide release parameters and local weather; the tool estimates downwind concentration envelopes and threshold exceedances. Outputs include CSV and GeoJSON for GIS, plus reproducible HTML/PDF reports. For training and preliminary analysis only; not a certified emergency-response substitute.",
