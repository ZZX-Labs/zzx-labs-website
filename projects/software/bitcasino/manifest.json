  "description": "bitcasino explores trust-minimized gaming on Bitcoin. Games run over Lightning channels with client-seeded randomness (CSPRNG: HMAC-SHA256(client_seed || server_nonce || round)), server commits revealed post-round, and optional DLC settlement for high-stake outcomes. Every round yields a reproducible transcript and hash chain so players can verify fairness and edge. Modules: dice, roulette, coin-flip, slots, and parimutuel pools with oracle-settled events.",
