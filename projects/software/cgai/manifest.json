  "description": "CGAI provides an adults-only creative/companion experience with configurable content controls, refusal logic for disallowed requests, and region-aware policy modes. Features include text generation, image generation/editing, TTS/STT pipelines, optional video composition workflows, watermarking/provenance tagging, and encrypted local profiles. Access requires verified 18+ and explicit consent to NSFW scope. The system logs key safety decisions (opt-in), supports revocation requests, and prioritizes privacy (local-first; no surprise collection).",
