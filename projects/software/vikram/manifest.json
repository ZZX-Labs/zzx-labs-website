  "description": "Vikram is a simple, file-first work-queue and task runner for batch processing and ETL-like pipelines. Define steps as small commands with clear inputs/outputs, and Vikram will discover sources, schedule work with safe concurrency, retry transient failures, and materialize deterministic artifacts with checksums. It can run locally or dispatch tasks over SSH to a handful of worker nodes â€” without a heavyweight message broker.",
