  "aboutHtml": "<p>Theophrastus (c. 371 – c. 287 BCE), Aristotle’s successor at the Lyceum, produced the earliest comprehensive works on plant life. His empirical methods—careful observation, classification by features, and linking form to function—anticipate modern data modeling. At ZZX-Labs, we channel this spirit into our taxonomies, knowledge graphs, and metadata architectures: build clear classes, measure the real world, and let structure serve discovery.</p>"
